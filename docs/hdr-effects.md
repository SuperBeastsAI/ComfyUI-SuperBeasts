## HDR Effects (SuperBeasts.AI)

The HDR Effects is an image processing application that enhances the dynamic range and visual appeal of input images. It provides a set of adjustable parameters to fine-tune the HDR effect according to user preferences.

### Features

- Adjusts the intensity of shadows, highlights, and overall HDR effect
- Applies gamma correction to control the overall brightness and contrast
- Enhances contrast and color saturation for more vibrant results
- Preserves color accuracy by processing the image in the LAB color space
- Utilizes luminance-based masks for targeted adjustments
- Blends the adjusted luminance with the original luminance for a balanced effect

### Parameter details

The application provides the following adjustable parameters:

- `hdr_intensity` (default: 0.5, range: 0.0 to 5.0, step: 0.01):
  - Controls the overall intensity of the HDR effect
  - Higher values result in a more pronounced HDR effect

- `shadow_intensity` (default: 0.25, range: 0.0 to 1.0, step: 0.01):
  - Adjusts the intensity of shadows in the image
  - Higher values darken the shadows and increase contrast

- `highlight_intensity` (default: 0.75, range: 0.0 to 1.0, step: 0.01):
  - Adjusts the intensity of highlights in the image
  - Higher values brighten the highlights and increase contrast

- `gamma_intensity` (default: 0.25, range: 0.0 to 1.0, step: 0.01):
  - Controls the gamma correction applied to the image
  - Higher values increase the overall brightness and contrast

- `contrast` (default: 0.1, range: 0.0 to 1.0, step: 0.01):
  - Enhances the contrast of the image
  - Higher values result in more pronounced contrast

- `enhance_color` (default: 0.25, range: 0.0 to 1.0, step: 0.01):
  - Enhances the color saturation of the image
  - Higher values result in more vibrant colors
